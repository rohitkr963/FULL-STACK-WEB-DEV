                            6. Write the properties of JavaScript?


1. Lightweight and Easy to Use:
JavaScript is a simple language that runs directly in the browser without extra steps. This makes it easy to use and fast to run.

2. Flexible with Variables:
You don’t have to tell JavaScript what type of data a variable is. For example, a variable can hold a number and then change to a word later.

javascript code

let item = 10;     // It's a number now
item = "Hello";    // Now it's a string

3. Works with Objects:
JavaScript lets you use objects, which are like containers that hold related data and functions. This helps organize your code better.

4. Responds to Events:
JavaScript can make things happen when a user interacts with a web page, like clicking a button or moving the mouse.

javascript  code

document.getElementById("myButton").onclick = function() {
    alert("Button clicked!");
};
5. Functions are Important:
In JavaScript, functions are very powerful. You can create them, store them in variables, and use them in many ways.

javascript code

function sayHi(name) {
    return "Hi, " + name;
}
6. Shares Features with Other Programs:
JavaScript lets one object take on properties from another object. This helps you reuse code.

7. Can Run Tasks Simultaneously:
JavaScript can handle tasks without waiting for other tasks to finish, like loading data while still responding to user clicks.

javascript  code

fetch('https://example.com/data')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => console.log(data));

8. Works Everywhere:
JavaScript runs on all web browsers and works across different operating systems, so it’s great for making websites that work for everyone.

9. Used for Both Front-End and Back-End:
JavaScript is used to make web pages interactive (front-end) and can also run on servers (back-end) using Node.js.

10. Lots of Built-in Tools:
JavaScript comes with many built-in functions and tools for things like working with text, dates, and more.

11. Can Change Web Pages:
JavaScript can update the content of a web page without reloading the whole page, making websites interactive and fun.

javascript code

document.getElementById("text").innerText = "Welcome to JavaScript!";
