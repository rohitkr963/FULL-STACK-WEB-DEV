11. What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript? Provide 
an example to demonstrate the difference. 



1. Definition:
null: This is an assignment value that represents "no value" or "no object." It is an intentional absence of any object value.
undefined: This means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. It is the default value of uninitialized variables.






// Example of undefined
let x; // Declared but not assigned a value
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
console.log(typeof x); // Output: "undefined"

// Example of null
let y = null; // Explicitly assigned null
console.log(y); // Output: null
console.log(typeof y); // Output: "object"

// Another comparison
console.log(x === y); // Output: false (undefined is not equal to null)
